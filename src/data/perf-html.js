    <div data-type="block" class="block m"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">4</span>John came, the one baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">5</span>And the whole region of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">6</span>And John was clothed with camel hair and a leather belt around his waist, and eating locusts and wild honey.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">7</span>And he was proclaiming, saying, “One mightier than I is coming after me, of whom the strap of his sandals I am not worthy to stoop down to untie. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">8</span>I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">9</span>And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and he was baptized by John in the Jordan. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">10</span>And immediately, coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being split open and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">11</span>And a voice came out of the heavens, “You are my beloved Son. I am well-pleased with you.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">12</span>And immediately, the Spirit compelled him to go out into the wilderness. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">13</span>And he was in the wilderness 40 days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving him.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">14</span>But after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God <span data-type="verses" class="verses">15</span>and saying, “The time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">16</span>And walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, were net-casting into the sea, for they were fishermen. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">17</span>and Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">18</span>And immediately, having left the nets, they followed him.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">19</span>And having gone on a little farther, he saw James, the {son} of Zebedee, and John, his brother, and they are mending the nets in the boat. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">20</span>And immediately, having called them and they having left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, they went away after him.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">21</span>And he enters into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbaths, having entered into the synagogue, he began to teach. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">22</span>And they were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as having authority and not as the scribes.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">23</span>And immediately there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">24</span>saying, “What to us and to you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">25</span>And Jesus rebuked it, saying, “Be silenced and come out from him!” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">26</span>And having thrown him down and having cried out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit went out from him.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">27</span>And they all were amazed, so they discussed among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching according to authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him!” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">28</span>And the news of him immediately went out everywhere into the whole surrounding region of Galilee.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">29</span>And immedately, having come out from the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">30</span>Now the mother-in-law of Simon was lying down, being sick with a fever, and immediately they speak to him concerning her. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">31</span>And having come near, he raised her up, having taken hold of {her} hand, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">32</span>Now when it became evening, after the sun had set, they were bringing to him all those having sickness and those possessed by demons. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">33</span>And the whole city was gathered together at the door. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">34</span>And he healed many having sickness with various diseases, and cast out many demons, but he was not permitting the demons to speak because they knew him.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">35</span>And very early in the night, having gotten up, he left and went away to a solitary place, and there he began to pray. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">36</span>And Simon and those who {were} with him searched for him, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">37</span>and found him, and say to him, “Everyone is seeking you.”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">38</span>And he says to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding towns, so that I may preach there also, because I came for this.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">39</span>And he went in all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out the demons.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">40</span>And a leper comes to him, begging him and kneeling down, saying to him, “If you would be willing, you are able to make me clean.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">41</span>And having been moved with compassion, having reached out his hand, he touched him, and says to him, “I am willing. Be cleansed.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">42</span>And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">43</span>But having strictly warned him, he immediately sent him away. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">44</span>And he says to him, “See that you may say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">45</span>But he, having gone out, began to proclaim often and to spread the word widely, so that he was able no longer to enter into a town openly, but he was out in desolate places, and they were coming to him from all sides.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="chapter" class="chapter">2</span><span data-type="verses" class="verses">1</span>And having entered again into Capernaum after {some} days, it was heard that he is at home. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">2</span>And many gathered so that there {was} no more space, not even at the door, and he began to speak the word to them.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">3</span>And they come bringing to him a paralytic, being carried by four men. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">4</span>And not being able to approach him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was, and having dug an opening, they lower the mat where the paralytic was lying.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">5</span>And Jesus, having seen their faith, says to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">6</span>But some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">7</span>“Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">8</span>And immediately Jesus, having perceived in his spirit that they are thinking in this manner within themselves, says to them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">9</span>Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say ‘Get up and take up your mat, and walk’?  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">10</span>But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins,” he says to the paralytic, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">11</span>“I say to you, get up, take up your mat, and go away to your house.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">12</span>And having gotten up and immediately having taken up the mat, he went out in front of everyone, so that they are all amazed and glorify God, saying, “We never saw thus.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">13</span>And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">14</span>And passing by, he saw Levi the {son} of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s tent, and he says to him, “Follow me.” And having gotten up, he followed him.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">15</span>And he happened to recline to eat in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples, for many also were following him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">16</span>And the scribes of the Pharisees, having seen that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, began to say to his disciples, “Why is he eating with the tax collectors and sinners?”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">17</span>And having heard this, Jesus says to them, “The ones being healthy do not have need of a physician, but the ones having sickness. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">18</span>And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and they come and say to him, “Because of what are the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting, but your disciples are not fasting?” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">19</span>And Jesus said to them, “The sons of the wedding chamber are not able to fast while the bridegroom is still with them, are they? As much time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">20</span>But days will come when the bridegroom may be taken away from them, and in those days, then they will fast. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">21</span>No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, but if not, the filler pulls away from it, the new from the old, and there is a worse tear.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">22</span>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, but if not, the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed, but new wine into fresh wineskins.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">23</span>And he happened on the Sabbaths to pass through the grainfields, and his disciples began to make {their} way, picking the heads of grain. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">24</span>And the Pharisees were saying to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths?”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">25</span>And he says to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he and the ones with him— <span data-type="verses" class="verses">26</span>how he went into the house of God during Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the presence, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and he also gave to those being with him?”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">27</span>And he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">28</span>Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="chapter" class="chapter">3</span><span data-type="verses" class="verses">1</span>And he entered into the synagogue again, and there was a man having a withered hand. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">2</span>And they were watching him closely, if he will heal him on the Sabbaths, so that they might accuse him.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">3</span>And he says to the man having the withered hand, “Stand up in the midst.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">4</span>And he says to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbaths to do good, or to do harm; to save a life, or to kill?” But they were keeping silent.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">5</span>And having looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their heart, he says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">6</span>And the Pharisees, having gone out, immediately were making counsel with the Herodians against him, as to how they might kill him.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">7</span>And Jesus, with his disciples, withdrew to the sea, and a great crowd followed from Galilee, and from Judea, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">8</span>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. A great crowd, hearing how much he was doing, came to him.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">9</span>And he spoke to his disciples so that a small boat might be waiting for him because of the crowd, so that they might not press against him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">10</span>For he healed many, so then as many as had diseases pressed against him so that they might touch him.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">11</span>And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they were falling down before him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">12</span>And he was often rebuking them so that they might not make him known.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">13</span>And he goes up on the mountain and summons those whom he himself wanted, and they went to him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">14</span>And he appointed 12 (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and so that he might send them to preach, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">15</span>and to have authority to cast out the demons. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">16</span>And he appointed the Twelve<span data-type="inlineGraft" class="graft footnote" data-subType="footnote" data-target="Yzk3YTI1YTUt" data-nBlocks="1" data-previewText="Some ancient manuscripts do not includehe appointed the Twelve"></span>&#8239;, and he added to Simon the name Peter;  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">17</span>and James the {son} of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, to whom he also added the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder; <span data-type="verses" class="verses">18</span>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the {son} of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">19</span>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">20</span>And he comes into a house, and the crowd gathers together again, so that they are not able even to eat bread. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">21</span>And those beside him, having heard about it, went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">22</span>And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He has Beelzebul” and “By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">23</span>But having called them to himself, in parables he was saying to them, “How is Satan able to cast out Satan? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">24</span>And if a kingdom might have been divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">25</span>And if a house might have been divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">26</span>And if Satan rose up against himself and was divided, he is not able to stand, but he has an end. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">27</span>But no one is able, having entered into the house of the strong man, to steal his possessions unless he would tie up the strong man first, and then he will plunder his house.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">28</span>Truly I say to you that all the sins of the sons of men will be forgiven, even whatever blasphemies they may blaspheme, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">29</span>but whoever might have blasphemed against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness to eternity, but is guilty of an everlasting sin”— <span data-type="verses" class="verses">30</span>because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">31</span>And his mother and his brothers come, and standing outside, they sent to him, summoning him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">32</span>And a crowd was sitting around him and they say to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers seek you outside.”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">33</span>And answering them, he says, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">34</span>And having looked around at those sitting in a circle around him, he says, “Behold, my mother and my brothers! <span data-type="verses" class="verses">35</span>For whoever may do the will of God, this is my brother, and sister, and mother.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="chapter" class="chapter">4</span><span data-type="verses" class="verses">1</span>And again, he began to teach beside the sea, and a large crowd is gathered around him. Therefore he had stepped into a boat on the sea to sit in it, and the whole crowd was on the shore beside the sea. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">2</span>And he was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching,  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">3</span>“Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">4</span>And it happened that as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and the birds came and devoured it. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">5</span>And other fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it did not have deep soil.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">6</span>And when the sun rose, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it was dried up. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">7</span>And other fell into the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it did not produce a crop.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">8</span>And other fell into the good soil, and it was producing a crop, growing up and being increased and yielding one, 30, and one, 60, and one, 100.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">9</span>And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">10</span>And when he was alone, those around him with the Twelve were asking him about the parables. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">11</span>And he began to say to them, “To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who {are} outside, everything is in parables,</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block q"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">12</span>so that looking, they may look but may not see,</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block q">and hearing, they may hear but may not understand,</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block q">so that they might not turn and it might be forgiven to them.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block m"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">13</span>And he says to them, “Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">14</span>The sower sows the word. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">15</span>Now these are the ones beside the road, where the word is being sown, but whenever they might have heard it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">16</span>And in the same manner, these are the ones being sown on the rocky ground, who, whenever they might have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">17</span>and they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then, tribulation or persecution having come because of the word, immediately they are caused to stumble.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">18</span>And others are the ones being sown into the thorns. These are the ones who have heard the word, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">19</span>but the cares of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires concerning other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">20</span>And those are the ones sown in the good soil, who hear the word and receive it, and produce a crop—one, 30, and one, 60, and one, 100.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">21</span>And he was saying to them, “The lamp does not come so that it might be put under a basket or under the bed, does it? Is it not so that it might be put on the lampstand? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">22</span>For nothing is hidden except so that it might be revealed, and nothing secret has happened except so that it might come to exposure. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">23</span>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">24</span>And he was saying to them, “Pay attention to what you hear. In that measure you use it will be measured to you, and it will be added to you. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">25</span>For he who has, it will be given to him, and he who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">26</span>And he was saying, “Thus is the kingdom of God: As a man may throw the seed on the ground, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">27</span>and he may sleep and may get up, night and day, and the seed may sprout and may grow—how, he himself does not know. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">28</span>The soil produces a crop of its own accord: First the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">29</span>And whenever it may have delivered the crop, he immediately sends forth the sickle because the harvest has come.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">30</span>And he was saying, “How might we compare the kingdom of God, or in what parable might we present it? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">31</span>{It is} like a mustard seed, which, when it may have been sown in the soil, being the smallest of all the seeds that {are} on the earth, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">32</span>and when it may have been sown, it grows and becomes greater than all the edible plants, and it makes large branches, so that the birds of the sky are able to make their nests in its shade.”</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">33</span>And with many such parables he was speaking the word to them, to the degree that they were able to hear; <span data-type="verses" class="verses">34</span>but he was not speaking to them without a parable, but by himself, he was explaining everything to his own disciples.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">35</span>And he says to them on that day, evening having come, “Let us cross over to the other side.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">36</span>And having left the crowd, they take him with them, as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">37</span>And a great storm of wind happens and the waves were breaking into the boat so as to already be filling the boat.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">38</span>And he himself was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. And they wake him up and say to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">39</span>And having been awakened, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be silent! Be still!” And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">40</span>And he said to them, “Why are you afraid?

For the seven had her as wife.”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">24</span>Jesus said to them, “Are you not being led astray because of this, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">25</span>For when they may rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like angels in the heavens.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">26</span>But concerning the dead that are raised, did you not read in the book of Moses, at the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">27</span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">28</span>And one of the scribes, having come up, having heard them discussing this together, having seen that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which is the first commandment of all?” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">29</span>Jesus answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">30</span>And you will love the Lord your God from your whole heart, and from your whole soul, and from your whole mind, and from your whole strength.’ <span data-type="verses" class="verses">31</span>The second {is} this, ‘You will love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other greater commandment than these.”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">32</span>And the scribe said to him, “Good, Teacher! According to truth you have said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">33</span>And to love him from the whole heart and from the whole understanding and from the whole strength, and to love the neighbor as oneself, is even more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">34</span>And Jesus, having seen him, that he had answered wisely, said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one any longer was daring to question him.</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">35</span>And answering, Jesus, teaching in the temple, said, “How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">36</span>David himself, in the Holy Spirit, said,</div>

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">38</span>And in his teaching, he was saying, “Watch out for the scribes, who are desiring to walk in long robes, and greetings in the marketplaces, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">39</span>and the chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at the banquets. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">40</span>They are devouring the houses of the widows, and as a pretext offer long prayers.

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">41</span>And having sat down across from the temple offering box, he was watching how the crowd puts money into the offering box.

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="chapter" class="chapter">13</span><span data-type="verses" class="verses">1</span>And as he is walking away from the temple, one of his disciples says to him, “Teacher, look!

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">3</span>And as he is sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew were asking him by himself, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">4</span>“Tell us, when will these things be? And what {is} the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">5</span>Now Jesus began to say to them, “Be careful that no one might deceive you. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">6</span>Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am!’ and they will deceive many.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">7</span>But when you might hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not worry; it is necessary for it to happen, but {it is} not yet the end. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">8</span>For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.

But whatever might be given to you in that hour, speak that; for you will not be the ones speaking, but the Holy Spirit. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">12</span>And brother will deliver brother to death, and a father, {his} child. And children will rise up against parents and put them to death. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">13</span>And you will be hated by everyone because of my name.

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">14</span>But when you might see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those {who are} in Judea flee to the mountains, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">15</span>but let the one on the housetop not go down nor go in to take anything from his house, <span data-type="verses" class="verses">16</span>and let the one in the field not turn back to the things behind to get his cloak.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">17</span>But woe to those having in the womb, and to those nursing in those days! <span data-type="verses" class="verses">18</span>But pray that it might not happen in winter. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">19</span>For there will be in those days tribulation—such as this kind has not happened from the beginning of creation which God created until now, and may certainly not happen. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">20</span>And if the Lord did not cut short the days, no flesh would be saved.

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">12</span>And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they were sacrificing the Passover lamb, his disciples say to him, “Where do you want us to go away to prepare, so that you might eat the Passover?” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">13</span>And he sends two of his disciples and says to them, “Go into the city, and a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you.

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">32</span>And they come to a place, the name of which {is} Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, “Sit here while I may pray.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">33</span>And he takes along Peter, and James, and John with him and began to be distressed and deeply troubled. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">34</span>And he says to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death.

The spirit indeed {is} willing, but the flesh {is} weak.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">39</span>And again, having gone away, he prayed, having said the same thing.  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">40</span>And again, having come, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down, and they did not know what to answer to him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">41</span>And he comes the third time and says to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting?

Behold, the one betraying me is near.”  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">43</span>And immediately, while he is still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrives, and a crowd with him with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">44</span>Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I may kiss, he it is.

Again the high priest was questioning him and saying to him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">62</span>But Jesus said, “I am;</div>
    <div data-type="block" class="block q">and you will see the Son of Man</div>

    <div data-type="block" class="block m"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">63</span>But the high priest, having torn his garments, says, “What need do we still have of witnesses? <span data-type="verses" class="verses">64</span>You heard the blasphemy.

    <div data-type="block" class="block p"><span data-type="verses" class="verses">66</span>And while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest comes to him. <span data-type="verses" class="verses">67</span>And having seen Peter warming himself, having looked closely at him, she says, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus.” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">68</span>But he denied it, saying, “Neither have I known nor do I understand what you are saying.” And he went out, outside into the courtyard.<span data-type="inlineGraft" class="graft footnote" data-subType="footnote" data-target="YmM2MmU5M2Qt" data-nBlocks="1" data-previewText="Some ancient copies add, “Then the rooster crowed,” but the best ancient copies do not have this phrase."></span>&#8239;  <span data-type="verses" class="verses">69</span>But the servant girl, having seen him {there}, began to say again to those standing around, “This one is from among them!” <span data-type="verses" class="verses">70</span>But he was denying it again.
